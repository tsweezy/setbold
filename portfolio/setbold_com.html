      <h2>Some History</h2>
      <p>This version of my personal website marks the third public iteration since I started teaching myself traditional web development, and it is a marked improvement over the previous iteration, which proudly featured a rather gaudy color palette and a lack of any clear direction or purpose.</p>
      <p>Mostly intended as a place for my résumé to live outside of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trvr-sweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> (which wasn't necessary anyway), the previous iteration of setbold.com was really more of an exercise than anything, and certainly wasn't intended to remain public for nearly a year.</p>
      <div class="click-zoom">
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox">
          <img src="../img/portfolio/setbold_com/setboldv1.jpeg" alt="" class="portfolio__article__img">
          <p class="portfolio__article__img__caption">The previous version of setbold.com, featuring my brave desert themed(?) color palette (what was I thinking?).</p>
        </label>
      </div>
      <p>The truth is, I had already begun the current iteration of the site by the time I pushed the source code to the server for hosting. In the process of creating that ugly duckling I had learned a great deal about what makes a good website, and ways I could improve from the ground-up next time around.</p>
      <h2>Simplicity First</h2>
      <p>Previous attempts to redesign setbold.com involved lots of grand plans and things to include for the fun of it. It wasn't until later that I began to ask myself if these things were truly necessary for the website to fulfill its intended purpose.</p>
      <p>In later iterations, I tasked myself with really trying to strip down the site to what was essential and realistic for me to achieve with the experience I had. As much as I wanted to include some of those really fancy widgets and buttery-smooth animations, that simply wasn't within the scope of what I could do with the experience I had. My main priority was getting a website I was proud of having created up on the web for the world to see—and I think the old version of the site would sooner turn people away than garner interest in what I do.</p>
      <p>After a number of fresh starts, I started coding when I finished this mockup in Adobe XD:</p>
      <div class="click-zoom">
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox">
          <img src="../img/portfolio/setbold_com/setboldXD.jpg" alt="" class="portfolio__article__img">
          <p class="portfolio__article__img__caption">The final mockup design before starting coding.</p>
        </label>
      </div>
      <p>There were a number of things which were trimmed down over the course of developing the site, such as removing those unnecessary arrows, shaving down the number of main pages (notably the résumé), and some other general simplifications.</p>
      <h2>A Learning Experience</h2>
      <p>To maximize my ability to learn about web programming, I opted not to use any frameworks or utilities that would abstract things for me beyond basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although it may have been a longer process in development, I feel I have a far greater understanding of how coding for the web works and the ways that many frameworks can simplify and enhance the experience of development.</p>
      <p>At this point, I'm eager to see what I could do with a web framework, and how things could be simplified and optimized to focus on the development of the product and not the tedium of its tools.</p>
